# Track_Python
Option 1 : We can call it "Drifter Track", simply. In this option, we got a one day's drifter track and forecast it a few days (depends on the parameter 'track_days') start at the last point of the drifter. What you need do is give Drifter ID, Filestyle and track_days. See the sample(image_style=animation), [click here.](./Samples of Animation/Option-1-drifter_track.gif) 

Option 2 : Named "Line Track". Allow us enter one or two points or specify numbers between two points as start points, then forecast or hindcast(depends on parameter 'track_way',forward or backward) a few days. You can also choose 'track_way=both' to track both forward and backward at the same time. There are optional features available, like boundary_switch, streamline,etc. [Here](./Samples of Animation/streamline.gif) is a sample of "streamline=ON".

Option 3 : Named "Multiple Track".  This option generates a simulation may of Cape Cod Bay first, you click on the map to add points where you want track. and the features are same to option 2 . Sample [here](./Samples of Animation/Option-3.gif) is an animation three points forecast one day.

Option 4 : Named "Box Track". See the sample(image_style=animation), [click here.](./Samples of Animation/Option4.gif)
